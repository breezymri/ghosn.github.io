This is the Project page of GHOSN (Geo-mapping Hi-Efficiency Over Spatial Nodes) Project, formed as part of the Nissan EV Zero Efficiency Hackathon.  The demo is hosted locally here at [http://ghosn.github.io](ghhosn.github.io).

It utilizes current and historical data points identifying the most efficient paths of travel over time and spatial parameters.
